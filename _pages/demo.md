## System Installation and Setup
### Initial RECAP setup using the RECAP CLI

This video shows the use of the RECAP CLI on an OpenStack infrastructure.
The setup process of a RECAP installation is shown.
On the left side the network topology in OpenStack, the right upper side displays the Rancher interface, while the right lower side shows the installation progress via the command line.

### Deployment of RECAP monitoring and landscaping components

Assuming a RECAP installation from the first demo scenario, this demo shows the setup of RECAP components for monitoring the instances and the landscape of the RECAP installation.

The left side shows the Rancher interface, and further on the Grafana dashboard as well as the neo4j Landscaper displaying the infrastracture.
The right lower side shows the setup progress via the command line.
